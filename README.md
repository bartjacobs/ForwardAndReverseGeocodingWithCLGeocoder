### Forward and Reverse Geocoding With CLGeocoder

#### Author: Bart Jacobs

The `CLGeocoder` class is part of the **Core Location** framework and it has been around since iOS 5 and macOS 10.8. Initially, the functionality of the `CLGeocoder` class was limited to reverse geocoding addresses into coordinates. Since iOS 8 and macOS 10.10, however, it is also possible to fetch the coordinates of addresses. In this tutorial, you learn how to do both using Xcode 8 and Swift 3.
